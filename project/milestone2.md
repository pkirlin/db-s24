# Project Milestone 2

Your task for this milestone is to design an E/R diagram and database schema for your group project.

- Review the project guidelines, in particular the part about how much data your database should store:

  **Database size**:  All project databases must be of nontrivial size. You may interpret nontrivial 
  based on your application. However, (1) there should be at least 8 nontrivial relations; and 
  (2) the total number of attributes times the total number of tuples should be at least 5000. 
  (These are guidelines only; if you feel your application warrants exceptions, come see me during office hours.)

- Construct an E/R diagram for your database. Then convert the diagram into a set of relations 
(express these as SQL CREATE TABLE statements). Follow the guidelines for E/R diagrams and schemas in homework 3.


What to turn in
- In hard copy (paper), turn in your E/R diagram and your CREATE TABLE statements.

# Project Milestone 4

Your task for this milestone is get your project halfway done!  
You can interpret that relatively freely, but you should aim to have roughly one-half
of the functionality completely working.  As a guideline, *half* of the items on the list you made in Part B from
Milestone 3 should be completed (this was the list where you itemized all the operations that your website should be
able to do).

## What to turn in

You may either email me your Python files with Flask code, 
or you can add me to your replit and share the link with me and I can see your code that way.
